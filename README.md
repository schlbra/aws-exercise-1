# Objective
Using a base Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of your choice, either based on Linux or Windows, create a running EC2 instance to meet the following objectives:

- The instance should be of type t2 .micro
- The instance should reside within region us-west-2
- The instance should use a 1 GB attached EBS volume and contain a valid
partition table with one partition. The partition should contain a valid file
system.
- The filesystem residing on the EBS volume should be mounted
automatically upon reboot of the EC2 instance.
- The instance should serve web pages via an appropriate service such as
apache or IIS. This service should start automatically upon boot.
- The instance should serve a web page index.html containing the text "Hello
AWS World". This file should reside on the filesystem within the EBS
volume and be served from the Document Root directory.
- The instance should effectively use security groups to restrict traffic to
HTTP and either RDP or SSH
- The instance should be associated with an Elasti c IP (EIP) address
